// Google recommends primary images are at least Images should be at least 696 pixels wide; multiple images are recommended for google to index
// TechCrunch feed embeds the primary image to the HTML of the synopsis... along with a Read More link
// We can do this by pre-pending an <img> element and post-pending a Read More link

    For best results, provide multiple high-resolution images (minimum of 300k pixels when multiplying width and height) with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.

For example:

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "image": [
    "https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
    "https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
    "https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"
   ]
